# About the PowerBI Canes vs. Zaxbys Project

# Using the various types of tools we learned about (sourcing, cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, etc.) we were instructed to develop our own project. I chose to scrape Google reviews, Yelp reviews, and social media hashtags to run sentiment analysis to compare the popularity between the two. I also scraped the total review scores to see what customers rated higher, and took Google analytic tools to see which brand was searched more in the entire country. This was our final project for my Data Mining course (ITEC 3355).
# I received an A on this project
